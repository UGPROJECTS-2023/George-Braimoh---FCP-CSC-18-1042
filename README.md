The project, "Design and Implementation of a Web-Based Recommender System for Rental Apartments," is a groundbreaking effort to enhance student housing at Federal University Dutse (FUD) campuses. Using a web-based recommender system and no-code tools, the project aims to simplify and personalize the apartment search process for students, providing tailored recommendations and saving time.

Inspired by a relevant paper, the online platform caters to both tenants and house owners in Bangladesh, introducing user-friendly features and efficient processes not found in existing house rental websites. Tenants can easily register, search for houses, and communicate with owners, while house owners can manage interactions seamlessly. The project's significance lies in improving nationwide house rental services and facilitating communication, with a focus on FUD's housing landscape.

By leveraging no-code tools and emphasizing user-centric solutions, the developed web application is designed to make house hunting easy for tenants and streamline the renting process for house owners. This aligns with the recent review by Matt Walsh, highlighting the importance of no-code tools in creating efficient websites, as demonstrated by platforms like Webflow.
